# Spotify Success Predictor

This project (this is a WIP) will predict whether a song will get featured in a particular curated or non-curated Spotify playlist using audio features, artist popularity, listener growth, and genre data. 

I wish I could say I will use this for good...but it will most definitely be used for EVIL!!! (Tweaking my musical creations little by little until I crack the Spotify playlisting algorithm and become famous!)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modular code.
- `results/`: Outputs like charts and reports.
